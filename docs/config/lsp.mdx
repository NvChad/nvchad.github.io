## Setup lsp server

Before starting, it is strongly recommended that you walk through the LSP configuration: [`lspconfig` repository](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig). Then check [server_configurations.md](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md) to make sure your language's LSP server is present there. You can install LSP servers manually or through `mason.nvim` (recommended option).


```lua
-- In order to modify the `lspconfig` configuration:
{
  "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
   config = function()
      require "plugins.configs.lspconfig"
      require "custom.plugins.lspconfig"
   end,
},
```

<br />

```lua
-- custom/configs/lspconfig.lua
local on_attach = require("plugins.configs.lspconfig").on_attach
local capabilities = require("plugins.configs.lspconfig").capabilities

local lspconfig = require "lspconfig"
local servers = { "html", "cssls", "clangd"}

for _, lsp in ipairs(servers) do
  lspconfig[lsp].setup {
    on_attach = on_attach,
    capabilities = capabilities,
  }
end

-- Without the loop, you would have to manually set up each LSP 
-- 
-- lspconfig.html.setup {
--   on_attach = on_attach,
--   capabilities = capabilities,
-- }
--
-- lspconfig.cssls.setup {
--   on_attach = on_attach,
--   capabilities = capabilities,
-- }
```
## Mason.nvim

The `mason.nvim` plugin is used to install LSP servers, formatters, linters, and debug adapters. It's better to list all your required packages and put them into your Mason override config, so they are automatically installed when running `MasonInstallAll`. You can find the exact name of the LSP packages using `:Mason`, that will open a window.

```lua
 {
   "williamboman/mason.nvim",
   opts = {
      ensure_installed = {
        "lua-language-server",
        "html-lsp",
        "prettier",
        "stylua"
      },
    },
  }
```

<br />

After modifying `mason`'s configuration, do:

- Run `nvim +MasonInstallAll`. This will install the listed binaries in the `ensure_installed` table.

Once the binaries are installed, you will have to configure them to properly work with LSP. NvChad does not provide any language configuration aside from lua.
