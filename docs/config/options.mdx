## Override default options

In order to override default options, it is recommended to put the options in `custom/init.lua`. New options can put in the same file as well. `autocmds` and `globals` can also be put inside `custom/init.lua`

## Snippets 

NvChad uses `luasnip` for snippets. In order to add custom snippets, you can pass the path to your snippets on: `vim.g.luasnippets_path = "your snippets path"`
