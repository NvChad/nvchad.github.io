## Override default highlight groups

It is possible to overwrite the highlighting groups for the selected theme:

- Make sure you use a valid highlight group
- Check your theme colors in this dir: `~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/base46/lua/base46/integrations`

<br/>

When modifying the custom highlight groups in your theme file, such as "onedark.lua", it is important to note that only the variables from "base_30" can be used for this purpose. Although hex colors can also be used in the "fg/bg" field, it is recommended to utilize the variable names (e.g. "blue", "darker_black", "one_bg", etc.) from your theme file as they will provide a better aesthetic. This way, there is no need to manually input the hex colors.

```lua
M.ui = {
   hl_override = {
      Pmenu = { bg = "white" },
      -- Pmenu = { bg = "#ffffff" }, this works too

      MyHighlightGroup = { -- custom highlights are also allowed
         fg = "red",
         bg = "darker_black"
      }
   },
}
```

In order to add custom highlights, thee same method can be used as above. However, instead of using `hl_override`, you have to use the `hl_add` field in chadrc.

## Customize themes

If you just want to customize an already existing theme, you can change the following configuration:

```lua
M.ui = {
   changed_themes = {
      onedark = {
         base_16 = {
            base00 = "#mycol",
         },
         base_30 = {
            red = "#mycol",
            white = "#mycol",
         },
      },

      nord = {
         -- and so on!
      },
   },
}
```

### Local themes

> (WARNING: Do this at your own risk because you might not be able to make nvchad themes like siduck.)

Keep in mind that:

- Default themes can be found in our [`base46`](https://github.com/NvChad/base46) repository.

Here is the default structure for NvChad themes:

```lua
-- place the file in custom/themes/<theme-name>.lua
-- for example: custom/themes/siduck.lua

local M = {}

M.base_30 = {
    -- my colors
}

M.base_16 = {
    -- my base16 colors
}

M.type = "dark" -- this is required or your theme will break on loading!

return M
```

<br/>

Finally, you just need to use the same name as the file!

```lua
M.ui = {
   theme = "siduck",
}
```
