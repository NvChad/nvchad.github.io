NvChad `v2.0`, a new release is now available, after all these months! From this release onwards, NvChad will take care about stability & exciting featuers at the same time.

Meaning that each release **( version like v3.0 v4.0 etc )** will be maintained in their own separate branches.  New versions will release based on new features, bug fixes will still be done in older versions of NvChad.

So Whats new in this release?

## Using lazy.nvim

- Lazy.nvim is used as the package manager, replacing packer so obviously it has minor syntax changes.

## Cachifying base46 

- Before base46 used to do some sort of computations like checking for user define highlight groups, highlight groups overrides, theme specific overrides i.e if user has changed colors in specific themes etc and then it would generate a final list of all highlight groups -> then load them.

- Now it base46 does all the computations beforehand ( when its compile module runs ) and then generates highlight group files in the form of bytecode which is faster to run.

- Now you can live-reload some parts of the UI table in chadrc.

## Chadrc completion

![chadrc types](/features/chadrc_types.webp)

- Big thanks to @Lucario387 for adding types to chadrc options. This will get you autocompletions for all nvchad options in the chadrc file!

## Example_config 

- To have a custom config quickstart, you can check the [example_config](https://github.com/NvChad/example_config/). If you want something featureful, check its `v2.0_featureful` branch.


## Notice To v1.0 users

As there's lazy.nvim being used in this release so this might be a breaking change for you, but dont worry, you can still use old nvchad version and slowly migrate to v2.0. 

- Migration changes are mentioned in this [section](/news/v2.0_migration).
