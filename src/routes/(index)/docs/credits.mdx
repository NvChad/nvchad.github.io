The NvChad team would love to acknowledge many projects which made this possible.

Thank you!

- [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) & [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- Plugin maintainers.

- Other NeoVim configurations which inspired @siduck to create NvChad:

  - [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim)
  - [SpaceVim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim)
  
 - Thanks to [ufoludek](https://t.me/ufoludek) for making fun of me when I (@siduck) was using "codeblocks" ( 3 years ago ). I got to know from him that vim could do the same thing which got me interested in vim.
