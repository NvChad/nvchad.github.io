## Basic debugging

- You can check the health of Neovim with the `checkhealth` command.
- Make sure you dont have syntax errors in your custom config files
- By default in NvChad sumneko lua LSP is enabled so it'll look for syntax errors etc for you.

## Before logging an issue

- [Search the GitHub issue list](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/issues?q=is%3Aissue)
- Then [log an issue, be sure to provide all prompted information](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/issues/new/choose)
- If it's a plugin issue, then make sure you're familiar with the lazy loading of default NvChad plugins as that plugin might depend on the default plugin which is lazy loaded.
