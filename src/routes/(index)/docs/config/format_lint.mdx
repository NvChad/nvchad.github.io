## Null-ls.nvim

It is recommended that you install `null-ls` to manage formatting & linting.
Here's a possible install configuration for `null-ls`:

```lua
{
  "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",

   dependencies = {
     "jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim",
     config = function()
       require "custom.configs.null-ls"
     end,
   },
 
   config = function()
      require "plugins.configs.lspconfig"
      require "custom.configs.lspconfig"
   end,
}
```

<br/>
- Dependencies are loaded after the original plugin (`lspconfig` in NvChad's case).
- `null-ls` is loaded after `lspconfig` as `lspconfig` is lazy-loaded.

## Configuration

Make sure to check [`null-ls` builtins](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim/blob/main/doc/BUILTINS.md) to get exact names for formatters, linters etc.

Here's an example configuration for `null-ls`, following the NvChad file directory structure:

```lua
-- custom/configs/null-ls.lua

local null_ls = require "null-ls"

local formatting = null_ls.builtins.formatting
local lint = null_ls.builtins.diagnostics

local sources = {
   formatting.prettier,
   formatting.stylua,

   lint.shellcheck,
}

null_ls.setup {
   debug = true,
   sources = sources,
}
```
<br/>

- Check [null-ls docs](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim/wiki/Formatting-on-save) for adding format on save.
Other things to take into account when configuring `null-ls` for NvChad:

- This shortcut is defined for code formatting: `<leader> + fm`.
- The linter, formatter or debugger that you will use in `null-ls` configuration, has to be downloaded via `mason` (that ensure_installed opt) or system wide. 
- Make sure the LSP servers for the filetypes are active for the relevant `null-ls` formatter and/or linter to work.
