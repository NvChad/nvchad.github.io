## Overview

NvChad uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugins management. Basically, NvChad expects a user plugin table, which then gets merged with the default plugins table. You can find the default table in: [`lua/plugins/init.lua`](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/blob/v2.0/lua/plugins/init.lua).

## Lazy loading

We lazy load almost 95% of the plugins, so we expect and recommend you to lazy load the plugins as well, as its efficient in reducing startuptime.

- We don't want users making NvChad slow just because they didn't lazy load plugins they've added.
- Please read the [lazy.nvim plugin specs](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-plugin-spec) docs to know what options are available for lazyloading etc.
- Try your best to lazy-load a plugin!

## Manage custom plugins

All NvChad default plugins will have `lazy = true` set. Therefore, if you want a plugin to be enabled on startup, change it to `lazy = false`.

It is recommended that you avoid saving any files in the `custom/plugins/*` directory.

> Our system utilizes the import feature provided by`lazy.nvim`, which imports all files in a directory and expects each file to return plugin tables. This behavior is undesirable for our purposes, so it is recommendeed to create a single file named **custom/plugins.lua**. This file will be imported by `lazy.nvim`, and no other files in the directory will be processed.

<br/>
- **custom/chadrc.lua**
```lua
M.plugins = "custom.plugins"
```

<br/>
- **custom/plugins.lua**
```lua
local plugins = {

  { "elkowar/yuck.vim" , lazy = false },  -- load a plugin at startup

  -- You can use any plugin specification from lazy.nvim
  {
    "Pocco81/TrueZen.nvim",
    cmd = { "TZAtaraxis", "TZMinimalist" },
    config = function()
      require "custom.configs.truezen" -- just an example path
    end,
  },

  -- this opts will extend the default opts 
  {
    "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
    opts = {
      ensure_installed = {"html", "css", "bash"},
    },
  },

  -- if you load some function or module within your opt, wrap it with a function
  {
   "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
   opts = {
     defaults = {
       mappings = {
         i = {
           ["<esc>"] = function(...)
               require("telescope.actions").close(...)
            end,
          },
        },
      },
    },
   },

   {
     "folke/which-key.nvim",
     enabled = false,
   }

}

return plugins
```
