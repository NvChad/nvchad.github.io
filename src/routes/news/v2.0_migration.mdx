# Breaking changes in v2.0

![v2.0 poster](/news/v2.0_migration.svg)

- Take your own time in migrating to v2.0.  This release is in a separate branch so technically you can still use old NvChad. 

- To use v2.0, you have to delete all old Neovim dirs (backup custom dir) and then re-install NvChad again 

## Lazy.nvim 

- This release uses lazy.nvim instead of packer.nvim for plugin management.
- The `M.plugins` variable in chadrc expects a string now instead of table.
- The string should be path of your file which returns a table, example : <u>**custom/plugins.lua**</u>
 
```lua
--  before 
M.plugins = require "custom.plugins"

--  now
M.plugins = "custom.plugins"
```

<br/>

- Rename your custom plugins dir to something else, like configs etc. It shouldnt be "plugins" (as per our example)  and update the path in your custom plugins table. 
- Also old plugin syntax has some slight changes now (as per lazy.nvim's syntax) 

 
```lua
-- before
["some plugin" ] = { options } 
 
-- now
{
  "some plugin",
   options
}
```
<br/>

- Check [lazy.nvim docs](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#examples) to know how it works & its syntax.

## Override opts

- `override_opts` which was used to override default plugin configs is now `opts`

## NvChad ui options

- These options can now be directly changed from chadrc file 

```lua
-- before 
["NvChad/ui"] = {
     override_opts = {
         statusline = {
             separator_style  = "round" 
          }
     }
}

-- now 
M.ui = {
    statusline = {
         separator_style = "round"
     }
}
```

## Removed Alpha-nvim 

- Its replaced by our own dashboard module which has a simple config & is lightweight. 
- Check the NvDash config in the [default_config file](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/blob/v2.0/lua/core/default_config.lua#L50)

## Removed commands & mappings

 Some mappings and commands have been removed. However their functions still exist, just make your own commands/mappings for them. Read our [api functions docs](http://nvchad.com/docs/api).

 **Removed commands** 

- Tbufpick , TbufLeft, TbufRight

 **Removed mappings** 

- `\` (to trigger tbufpick).
- `leader + tt` (for toggling themes)
