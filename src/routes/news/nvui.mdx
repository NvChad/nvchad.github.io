# NvUI v3.0 ( NvChad's UI + Base46 )

![nvui v3.0](/news/nvui.webp)

## Introduction

NvChad got famous due to its look, which are powered by its Base46 & UI plugin!

- Base46 : Powerful Collection of 68 beautifully crafted themes, extensible and compiled to bytecode
- UI : Collection of various ui's like statusline, tabline, dashboard, cheatsheet etc

Now Non NvChad users can use both the plugins! check ui repo's readme for more info.

## TailwindCSS & CSS Lsp in Cmp

- Read `:h nvui.cmp` to enable it

## Improved Nvdash UI

![nvdash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c7e2c8f-8940-42ea-9c18-7456768d2d05)

Note: Nvdash config has been moved to the root table instead of UI

```lua
--Before :

M.ui = {
  nvdash = { ... }
}

-- Now: 
M.nvdash = { ... }
```
<br/>
Check the syntax of buttons in [nvconfig file](https://github.com/NvChad/ui/blob/v3.0/lua/nvconfig.lua#L61)


## Automatic Mason installation 

- MasonInstallAll command will now capture all the mason tools from your config
- Supported plugins are : lspconfig, nvim-lint, conform.nvim

- So for example if you have lspconfig like this :

```lua 
require("lspconfig").html.setup{}
require("lspconfig").clangd.setup{}
``` 
<br/>

Then running MasonInstallAll will install both the mason pkgs 

check `:h nvui.mason` for more info

## Mixing colors with base46

Base46 now allows mixing of colors. Check the [PR](https://github.com/NvChad/base46/pull/262) to understand the usecases.

```lua
M.base46 = {
  hl_override = {
     Function = { "blue", "red", 20 }
  }
}
```

## Volt framework

![volt](/news/volt.webp)

- Plugin to create interactive UI in Neovim, clickable & hoverable!

- This release v3.0 was going to be a huge one as the volt ui framework was being built in this UI plugin itself.

- But for the greater good I decided it to be a standalone plugin and all its helper plugins are standalone plugins.

- So All Neovim users will benefit from it and they're general plugins now!

- Check the [blog post](/news/volt) showcasing volt framework and its plugins.
