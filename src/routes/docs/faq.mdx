## Icons not working

- Setup a [nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/#home) as your terminal's default font.

## Set highlight groups 

- For that you have to add highlight groups in hl_override ( existing ones which NvChad defines), for new ones, use hl_add. 
- Check [theming docs](https://nvchad.com/docs/config/theming) for detailed info.


## Customize theme colors 

- Use `changed_themes` option in chadrc. check [theming docs](https://nvchad.com/docs/config/theming#customize_themes) for detailed info.

## Custom local base46 themes

- To make a custom local theme that's the base46 format, you have to create `/lua/themes/mytheme.lua`. Check [base46 docs](https://github.com/NvChad/base46/blob/v2.0/README.md) for more info.


## Can I remove base46?

- No, NvChad hard-depends on base46, just use another config.

## Mapping Ctrl + o / i keys

- In Nvchad `<Tab> & <S-Tab>` are mapped by default and nvim maps to `<C-i>` if `<Tab>` key is mapped. [Check](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16209213/vim-jump-forward-with-c-i-doesnt-work-for-me-too-snipmate/16209534#16209534)

- To map those keys, you should either disable `<Tab>` in your custom mappings file or have certain settings in your terminal config, for example:  alacritty config : 

```bash
key_bindings:
   - { key: I, mods: Control, chars: "\x1b[105;6u" }
 ```

- **NOTE**: keymaps in NvChad are case-sensitive, to delete it you need to use lowercase `<tab>`. Add this to your mappings.lua:

```lua
-- Disable mappings
local nomap = vim.keymap.del

nomap("n", "<tab>")
```

## NvChad's color is weird

- You might be using a terminal that doesn't support true color. This problem is very common for those who use the default MacOS terminal, opt to use [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) instead. 


## Syntax highlighting not working

- Make sure you have installed the treesitter parser for the language i.e `TSInstall lua`.

## CursorLine not showing

- We set it to only number by default, to have cursorline highlight shown, add :

```lua
vim.o.cursorlineopt = "both"
```
