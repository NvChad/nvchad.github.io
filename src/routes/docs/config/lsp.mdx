## Setup lsp server

Before starting, it is strongly recommended that you walk through the LSP configuration [lspconfig repository](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).

Then check [configs.md](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/configs.md) to make sure your language's LSP server is present there.

- **Plugin table**

```lua
{
  "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
   config = function()
      require "configs.lspconfig"
   end,
},
```

<br />

- **configs/lspconfig.lua**

```lua
require("nvchad.configs.lspconfig").defaults()

local servers = { "html", "cssls" }
vim.lsp.enable(servers)

-- to configure lsps further read :h vim.lsp.config
```
## Mason.nvim

Run the `MasonInstallAll` command

<br />

> Once the binaries are installed, you will have to configure them to properly work with LSP, conform.nvim, nvim-lint, nvim-dap etc. It depends on what you installed. <u>**NvChad does not provide any language configuration aside from lua**</u>.
