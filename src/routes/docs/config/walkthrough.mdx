# How does NvChad work? 

## Understanding the basics

Before getting into the topic, first you should understand the `vim.tbl_deep_extend` function which is used for merging tables and their values recursively.  

- The function `vim.tbl_deep_extend` is normally used to merge 2 tables, and its syntax looks like this: 

```lua
-- table 1
local person = {
    name = "joe",
    age = 19,
    skills = {"python", "html"},
}

-- table 2
local someone = {
    name = "siduck",
    skills = {"js", "lua"},
}

-- "force" will overwrite equal values from the someone table over the person table
local result = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", person, someone)

-- result : 
{
    name = "siduck",
    age = 19,
    skills = {"js", "lua"},
}

-- The list tables wont merge cuz they dont have keys 
```

## Main Config Structure

 - [NvChad/NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) repo, this contains plugins, options, mappings, autocmds.
 - [NvChad/starter](https://github.com/NvChad/starter) - This is a minimal config which shows how to use the nvchad repo as a plugin.
 - Users will be using the starter config or can create their own

 config structure of the main nvchad repo :
```lua
├── lua/
│   ├── nvchad/
│   │   ├── autocmds.lua
│   │   ├── mappings.lua
│   │   └── options.lua
│   ├── plugins/
│   │   ├── init.lua
│   │   └── ui.lua
│   └── configs/
│       ├── cmp.lua
│       └── more.. 
└── nvconfig.lua  
```
<br/>
- example module import, `require "nvchad.options"`
- nvconfig.lua is the list of all options for both ui/base46 repo!

## Chadrc.lua

- This file is meant to have structure of [nvconfig.lua](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/blob/v2.5/lua/nvconfig.lua), check the nvconfig.lua for knowing all supported options.
- So nvconfig returns a table of config and then merges chadrc's table.
- And you put this file in your `/lua` folder

## Themes

You can see all the themes with the following keymap: `<leader> + th`.

> The `leader` key is the  <kbd>space</kbd>  in NvChad. 

## Mappings

If you want to know all the keymaps, you can run the following commands:

- `NvCheatsheet`
- `Telescope keymaps`
