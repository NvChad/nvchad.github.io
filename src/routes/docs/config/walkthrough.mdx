# How does NvChad work? 

## Understanding the basics

Before getting into the topic, first you should understand the `vim.tbl_deep_extend` function which is used for merging tables and their values recursively.  

- The function `vim.tbl_deep_extend` is normally used to merge 2 tables, and its syntax looks like this: 

```lua
-- table 1
local person = {
    name = "joe",
    age = 19,
    skills = {"python", "html"},
}

-- table 2
local someone = {
    name = "siduck",
    skills = {"js", "lua"},
}

-- "force" will overwrite equal values from the someone table over the person table
local result = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", person, someone)

-- result : 
{
    name = "siduck",
    age = 19,
    skills = {"js", "lua"},
}

-- The list tables wont merge cuz they dont have keys 
```

## Chadrc.lua

- This file is meant to have structure of [nvconfig.lua](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/blob/starter/lua/nvconfig.lua), check the nvconfig.lua for knowing all supported options.
- So nvconfig returns a table of config and then merges chadrc's table.
- For non nvchad users, you can just use nvconfig file ( without chadrc code from it) and put it in your /lua dir

## Themes

You can see all the themes with the following keymap: `<leader> + th`.

> The `leader` key is the  <kbd>space</kbd>  in NvChad. 

## Mappings

If you want to know all the keymaps, you can run the following comands:

- `NvCheatsheet`
- `Telescope keymaps`
