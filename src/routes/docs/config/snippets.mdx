## Luasnip 

NvChad uses `luasnip` plugin for handling snippets, by default it uses `friendly-snippets` plugin which provides snippets for many languages . 

- But you would want to extend or add your own snippets so read [luasnip docs](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#loaders).

## Globals

These are the globals you can use to include the path of your snippets. Put them in **custom/init.lua**.

```lua 
-- vscode format i.e json files
vim.g.vscode_snippets_path = "your snippets path"

-- snipmate format 
vim.g.snipmate_snippets_path = "your snippets path"

-- lua format 
vim.g.lua_snippets_path = vim.fn.stdpath "config" .. "/lua/custom/lua_snippets"
```
<br/>
> The above code is an example in which we first get the path of nvim config and then add our custom snippets dir
