## Formatting 

- There are many formatter plugins but we use [conform.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim) in our example_config.
- Read its docs and the conform config in the [example_config](https://github.com/NvChad/example_config/blob/v2.0/configs/conform.lua) repo


## Linting 

- Most of the times the lsp's just enough for diagnostic messages, linting etc. Although you can use plugins like
[nvim-lint](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint).
