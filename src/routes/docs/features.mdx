# Inbuilt features

- NvChad is built upon its personal plugins and many general Neovim plugins, below are the features that are provided by nvchad plugins **( our ui plugin, base46 )**

## Base46

- Base46 is NvChad's highly performant theming plugin and has 68 themes.

#### How it works?

- Gets highlight groups 
- Do some computations i.e. check for overridden highlight groups, new highlight groups, theme overrides, custom user themes etc.  
- Now, base46 compiles all of that into bytecode.
- Integration files aren't loaded by default; for example highlight group for telescope, nvimtree etc are put into different files.
- highlight groups are lazyloaded i.e. you load them when needed 
- **example : dofile(vim.g.base46_cache .. "cmp")**
- In the below video, you can see that the chadrc file's ( user config ) UI related options reload on the fly

## Theme switcher

- A theme switcher with telescope.nvim that reloads themes on the fly using the base46 plugin + plenary.nvim.

## Statusline 

- We have our own statusline module ( our UI Plugin ) which has 4 statusline styles

## Tabufline

- NvChad's tabufline module ( from UI Plugin ) is a mix of tabline & bufferline. 
- It manages buffers & tabs, buttons in it are clickable
- Each tab will have its own set of buffers stored, and the tabufline will show those only.
- Think of it like workspaces on Linux/Windows where windows stay in their own workspaces, but in vim buffers from all tabs will be shown in every tab!
