# Inbuilt features

- NvChad is built upon its personal plugins and many general Neovim plugins, below are the features that are provided by nvchad plugins **( our ui plugin, base46 )**

## Base46

- Base46 is NvChad's highly performant theming plugin and has 68 themes.

#### How it works?

- Gets highlight groups 
- Do some computations i.e. check for overridden highlight groups, new highlight groups, theme overrides, custom user themes etc.  
- Now, base46 compiles all of that into bytecode.
- Integration files aren't loaded by default; for example highlight group for telescope, nvimtree etc are put into different files.
- highlight groups are lazyloaded i.e. you load them when needed 
- **example : dofile(vim.g.base46_cache .. "cmp")**
- In the below video, you can see that the chadrc file's ( user config ) UI related options reload on the fly

## Theme switcher

- A theme switcher with telescope.nvim that reloads themes on the fly using the base46 plugin + plenary.nvim.

## Statusline 

- We have our own statusline module ( our UI Plugin ) which has 4 statusline styles

## Tabufline

- NvChad's tabufline module ( from UI Plugin ) is a mix of tabline & bufferline. 
- It manages buffers & tabs, buttons in it are clickable
- Each tab will have its own set of buffers stored, and the tabufline will show those only.
- Think of it like workspaces on Linux/Windows where windows stay in their own workspaces, but in vim buffers from all tabs will be shown in every tab!

## Automating Mason installation 

- MasonInstallAll command will now capture all the mason tools from your config
- Supported plugins are : lspconfig, nvim-lint, conform.nvim

- So for example if you have lspconfig like this :

```lua 
require("lspconfig").html.setup{}
require("lspconfig").clangd.setup{}
``` 
<br/>

Then running MasonInstallAll will install both the mason pkgs 

check `:h nvui.mason` for more info

# General Neovim plugins

- These plugins aren't related to nvchad, we just tweak them a bit and theme the UI related ones.

## Telescope.nvim

- [Telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is a highly extensible fuzzy finder over lists. Built on the latest awesome features from Neovim core. Telescope is centered around modularity, allowing for easy customization.
- Below are 2 styles of telescope in nvchad ( bordered and borderless )

## Nvim-tree.lua

- [`nvim-tree.lua`](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua) is a file explorer tree for Neovim written in Lua.

![nvim tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siduck/dotfiles/all/rice%20flex/nvimtree.png)

- Note that that's just the cmp look in everblush theme, there are more 57 themes! You can hide cmp icons, cmpkind txt etc from the user config ( chadrc ) itself! 

## Auto-completion & LSP

- [`nvim-lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) is used along with cmp for completion and [`luasnip`](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip)  + [`friendly-snippets`](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets) for snippet completion!
